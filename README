DS9 Python Visualization Program Viewing Survey Footprints over SDSS Stripe 82

This footprint visualization program is meant to create images with survey footprint
overlays on top of a background field. The goal is for these images to be used as needed for
research purposes (i.e. talks, posters, papers, etc.)

This program requires the python packages astropy and pyds9.  As well as the imagining 
visualization application SAOImage DS9.  Instructions for how to obtain these are found here:

For astropy,

For pyds9 and the DS9 app,

****************************************  Important  ****************************************
For Mac users the Xcode version of DS9 should be installed.

DS9 needs to be added to the environment path variable for pyds9 to properly function.  After 
dowloading, and unzipping, I recommended moving the two items (ds9 and ds9.zip) to the home 
directory and placed in a directory titled DS9.  This directory can then be added to the 
environment path.

Example:
In my .bash_profile file I have added the lines,
	# Set path to DS9
	export PATH=/Users/rstone/DS9:$PATH
