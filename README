Python Visualization Program Viewing Survey Footprints over SDSS Stripe 82

This footprint visualization program is meant to create images with survey footprint
overlays on top of a background field. The goal is for these images to be used as needed for
research purposes (i.e. talks, posters, papers, etc.)

######################################  Requirements  ######################################

This program requires the python packages astropy and APLpy (Astronomical Plotting Library in
Python). Information on these packages, and instructions for how to obtain them are found here:

For astropy,

	http://www.astropy.org/

If using Anaconda Python, astropy is already installed.

For APLpy,

	https://aplpy.github.io/

If using Anaconda Python, APLpy can be obtained using pip,

	> pip install aplpy
	> pip install pyregion
	

****************************************  Important  ****************************************
Though the APLpy webpage lists the pyregion package as an optional dependency, this program 
makes heavy use of pyregion and requires it be installed.  Instructions for how to install 
this package is included on the APLpy webpage (if using Anaconda Python, install with pip).

################################  Installation Instructions  ################################

To install:

	# Clone the repository from GitHub.  Move to the desired directory where the program
	# and dependent files will be located.
	> git clone https://github.com/KazooBoy/Data_Visualization2.git
	> cd Data_Visualization2

To run:

	# From the terminal
	> python visual.py

or
	
	# Start up python
	> python
        ... (startup messages) ...
	>>> from visual import *
	>>> visual()

######################################  Introduction  ######################################

After starting the program, it will first ask where to save any images with the save feature.
Simply type in the name of an existing directory, or type "D" to use the current working
directory.

A window will open that contains the dust background image on the righthand side, with 
several buttons on the lefthand side.

The first button, "Stripe 82 Title", will turn the Stripe 82 title in the image on or off.

The next set of buttons are the six wavelength classes which contain the survey regions to 
be plotted.  Clicking one of these buttons will open another window containing the individual
regions.  There are some region buttons that will open one more window, which just asks for
futher specification on what to plot given the broader survey.  This window will give
instructions on what to type, then simply press "Enter" to make the region appear in the image.
Keep in mind that what is entered must be in lowercase.

The "Save Image" button is meant to do just that, save the current image as seen in the 
plotting window to the right.  It will open a window that contains buttons representing
different file formats that the image could be saved as.  Clicking one of these will open 
a window prompting for a name for the image, then just press "Enter".

The "Region Titles" button is a feature request that just toggles the names of each region
plotted in the image on or off.

Finally, the "Clear All Footprints" button (which also appears in each wavelength class window)
will clear the entire image of all presently plotted regions, while leaving the status of the 
Stripe 82 title and region titles as they were.

##########################################  Notes  ##########################################

Certain regions are plotted as a polygon using many many points, while some are plotted as 
many many polygons with few points, but just as many points in the whole file.  As such, 
these regions will take some time to load.
